This Linux kernel module, written in C, is a fine example to demonstrate several key concepts in kernel programming, such as Kernel Threads, Process States, and Kernel Task iteration. Below is a conceptual breakdown of the program:

### 1. **Kernel Thread:**
The program creates a kernel thread named `print_running_thread` to print out information about processes in a running state. The kernel thread is started at module initialization and is stopped at module exit.
```c
print_thread = kthread_run(print_running_thread, NULL, "print_running_cpu");
kthread_stop(print_thread);
```

### 2. **Process States:**
The `get_task_state` function translates the process state value to a string representation. For instance, if a task’s state is `TASK_RUNNING`, it will return the string "TASK_RUNNING". If the task state is unknown, it will return a custom string showing the unknown type.
```c
switch (state) {
    case TASK_RUNNING:
        return "TASK_RUNNING";
    ...
    default:
    {
        sprintf(buffer, "Unknown Type:%ld", state);
        return buffer;
    }
}
```

### 3. **Iterating Over Tasks:**
Within the kernel thread function `print_running_thread`, there’s a loop where the program iterates over each task in the system using the `for_each_process` macro. For each process, if the process state is `TASK_RUNNING`, it prints the process name, PID, and state.
```c
for_each_process(task_list) {
    if (task_list->state == TASK_RUNNING)
        pr_info("Process: %s\t PID:[%d]\t State:%s\n", 
                task_list->comm, task_list->pid,
                get_task_state(task_list->state));
}
```

### 4. **Time Delays:**
After printing the details about the running tasks, the thread sleeps for 500 milliseconds before checking again. This is achieved by using `msleep(500);`.

### 5. **Module Initialization and Exit:**
When the module is loaded into the kernel, the `test_tasks_init` function is called, initiating the kernel thread. Conversely, when the module is removed, the `test_tasks_exit` function is called, stopping the kernel thread.
```c
module_init(test_tasks_init);
module_exit(test_tasks_exit);
```

### In Summary:
This program is a prime illustration of using kernel threads to periodically access and display kernel-level information (processes running) without affecting user space, showcasing the concept of process states and how to interact with and manipulate kernel-level process information efficiently.
